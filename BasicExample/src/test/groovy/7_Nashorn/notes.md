# General notes

1. Quote from Spck Docs:
   > Stubbing is the act of making collaborators respond to method calls in a certain way. When stubbing a method, you donâ€™t care if and how many times the method is going to be called; you just want it to return some value, or perform some side effect, whenever it gets called.
   
    - The "You dont care the number of times its getting called" is SUPER important difference.  Not following this will cause weird behavior.
